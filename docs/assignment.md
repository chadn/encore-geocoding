# Senior Back-end Developer - Take Home Assessment

Hi, welcome to Faura’s technical assessment! The purpose of this is to see if you can code, work within our team, and think about what it would take to scale what you’ve built out. The assessment is intentionally vague to see how you interpret it.

Please submit the technical assessment by next Wednesday, March 19th. If you need to extend the deadline, reach out to Amanda and let her know!

**The assessment:**

-   **We want you to build an API in a Typescript framework that consumes information from another free API.**
-   You can model this in any way you wish, or add business logic as you want. The idea is it should take only an hour or so, and we would like it to be really generalized so that you can re-use it as a portfolio project.
-   You can use Encore.ts if you wish, but any framework is up to you.

**The call:**

-   When we receive your take-home, we will review it and potentially move to the team call. That will be between Amanda and someone else on the Faura development team for about 1 hour. It will be more of a system design call. We might ask you to modify code, to write documentation, or to work out how things will scale or other features will be added.

**Just to note:**

-   Although we know generative AI tools are really helpful for developers, we will ask that you don’t use them for development during this assessment. We want to know your development skills, not ChatGPT’s.
-   Please put the repo up on Github and share with us (@TanviAtFaura, @zakirangwala @codingiswhyicry), or email a package. It does not need to be containerized, but instructions on how to run are needed. Include the .env (if one exists) file in the email, please!
